    <p>Pasta tossed with a garlic & lemon sauce. So simple, yet so delicious.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package farfalle (bow tie) pasta</li>
        <li>1 head broccoli, cut into florets</li>
        <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Warm olive oil in a small frying pan over low heat. Slowly cook garlic in oil until golden, about 2 to 3 minutes. Be very careful not to burn garlic. Stir in lemon juice, and season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water. About 5 minutes before pasta is done, drop broccoli into the pasta water. Continue to cook until pasta is cooked and broccoli is crisp-tender. Drain.</li>
        <li>Toss pasta, broccoli, and lemon sauce in a large bowl. Sprinkle with grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
